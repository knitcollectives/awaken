          release cords attaching you with harmful relationships and/or memories. typically followed by reiki healing.

          relationships that are feeding you negative energy or a person, memory, event that took place can be released from your luminous being. you no longer have to be a victim to the damaging emotions we all experience. you can feel an objective view of what it was that may be affecting your life. this is achieved by a personal session to release etheric cord connections to all damaging relations. step into oneness through spirit revival! connect further with results you need on a personal level in a session of healing where you are guided into deep meditation on a reiki massage table with a healing medicine wheel reiki blanket. many attachments/connections can be severed in one session. ethereal cords are severed & you are then filled with healing light of reiki. divorces have been made easier, and co-dependency/fear of loss that is deeply rooted in many of us can be transformed into light. marissa is an experienced medium in cord release with angels & guides, facilitating a very effective modality for liberating & healing. shamanism work helps you reunite with purpose & has a common ground of uniting one with the earth & healing the luminous body.
